*1* Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,
*2* And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
*3* Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
*4* I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
*5* Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
*6* That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
*7* For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.
*8* Why, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,
*9* Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
*10* I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
*11* Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:
*12* Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:
*13* Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:
*14* But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
*15* For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;
*16* Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
*17* If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
*18* If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on my account;
*19* I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.
*20* Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
*21* Having confidence in your obedience I wrote to you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.
*22* But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.
*23* There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;
*24* Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.
*25* The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

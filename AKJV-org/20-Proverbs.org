#+title: Proverbs

* 1
*1* The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
*2* To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
*3* To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
*4* To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
*5* A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:
*6* To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
*7* The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
*8* My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:
*9* For they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains about your neck.
*10* My son, if sinners entice you, consent you not.
*11* If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:
*12* Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
*13* We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
*14* Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:
*15* My son, walk not you in the way with them; refrain your foot from their path:
*16* For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
*17* Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
*18* And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.
*19* So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which takes away the life of the owners thereof.
*20* Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:
*21* She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,
*22* How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
*23* Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known my words to you.
*24* Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
*25* But you have set at nothing all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
*26* I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;
*27* When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes on you.
*28* Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
*29* For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
*30* They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
*31* Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
*32* For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
*33* But whoever listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
* 2
*1* My son, if you will receive my words, and hide my commandments with you;
*2* So that you incline your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;
*3* Yes, if you cry after knowledge, and lift up your voice for understanding;
*4* If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;
*5* Then shall you understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
*6* For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
*7* He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
*8* He keeps the paths of judgment, and preserves the way of his saints.
*9* Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yes, every good path.
*10* When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul;
*11* Discretion shall preserve you, understanding shall keep you:
*12* To deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaks fraudulent things;
*13* Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
*14* Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
*15* Whose ways are crooked, and they fraudulent in their paths:
*16* To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;
*17* Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.
*18* For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.
*19* None that go to her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
*20* That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
*21* For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
*22* But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
* 3
*1* My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:
*2* For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.
*3* Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them on the table of your heart:
*4* So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
*5* Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not to your own understanding.
*6* In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.
*7* Be not wise in your own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
*8* It shall be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones.
*9* Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the first fruits of all your increase:
*10* So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.
*11* My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
*12* For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.
*13* Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.
*14* For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
*15* She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.
*16* Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.
*17* Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
*18* She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.
*19* The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.
*20* By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
*21* My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
*22* So shall they be life to your soul, and grace to your neck.
*23* Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
*24* When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.
*25* Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.
*26* For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.
*27* Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
*28* Say not to your neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when you have it by you.
*29* Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.
*30* Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.
*31* Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
*32* For the fraudulent is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
*33* The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.
*34* Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the lowly.
*35* The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
* 4
*1* Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
*2* For I give you good doctrine, forsake you not my law.
*3* For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
*4* He taught me also, and said to me, Let your heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
*5* Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
*6* Forsake her not, and she shall preserve you: love her, and she shall keep you.
*7* Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all your getting get understanding.
*8* Exalt her, and she shall promote you: she shall bring you to honor, when you do embrace her.
*9* She shall give to your head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to you.
*10* Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of your life shall be many.
*11* I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths.
*12* When you go, your steps shall not be straitened; and when you run, you shall not stumble.
*13* Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is your life.
*14* Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
*15* Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
*16* For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
*17* For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
*18* But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.
*19* The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
*20* My son, attend to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
*21* Let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the middle of your heart.
*22* For they are life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
*23* Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
*24* Put away from you a fraudulent mouth, and perverse lips put far from you.
*25* Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.
*26* Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.
*27* Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove your foot from evil.
* 5
*1* My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow your ear to my understanding:
*2* That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.
*3* For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
*4* But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
*5* Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
*6* Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.
*7* Hear me now therefore, O you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
*8* Remove your way far from her, and come not near the door of her house:
*9* Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel:
*10* Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labors be in the house of a stranger;
*11* And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,
*12* And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
*13* And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!
*14* I was almost in all evil in the middle of the congregation and assembly.
*15* Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.
*16* Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
*17* Let them be only your own, and not strangers' with you.
*18* Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.
*19* Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.
*20* And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
*21* For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.
*22* His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.
*23* He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
* 6
*1* My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,
*2* You are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth.
*3* Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.
*4* Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
*5* Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
*6* Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
*7* Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
*8* Provides her meat in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
*9* How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you arise out of your sleep?
*10* Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
*11* So shall your poverty come as one that travels, and your want as an armed man.
*12* A naughty person, a wicked man, walks with a fraudulent mouth.
*13* He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;
*14* Frowardness is in his heart, he devises mischief continually; he sows discord.
*15* Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
*16* These six things does the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:
*17* A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
*18* An heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
*19* A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.
*20* My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:
*21* Bind them continually on your heart, and tie them about your neck.
*22* When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you wake, it shall talk with you.
*23* For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
*24* To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
*25* Lust not after her beauty in your heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.
*26* For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
*27* Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
*28* Can one go on hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
*29* So he that goes in to his neighbor's wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.
*30* Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
*31* But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
*32* But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul.
*33* A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
*34* For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
*35* He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
* 7
*1* My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with you.
*2* Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye.
*3* Bind them on your fingers, write them on the table of your heart.
*4* Say to wisdom, You are my sister; and call understanding your kinswoman:
*5* That they may keep you from the strange woman, from the stranger which flatters with her words.
*6* For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
*7* And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
*8* Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
*9* In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
*10* And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.
*11* (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
*12* Now is she without, now in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner.)
*13* So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,
*14* I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
*15* Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.
*16* I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
*17* I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
*18* Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
*19* For the manager is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
*20* He has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
*21* With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
*22* He goes after her straightway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
*23* Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastens to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life.
*24* Listen to me now therefore, O you children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
*25* Let not your heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
*26* For she has cast down many wounded: yes, many strong men have been slain by her.
*27* Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
* 8
*1* Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
*2* She stands in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
*3* She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
*4* To you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
*5* O you simple, understand wisdom: and, you fools, be you of an understanding heart.
*6* Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
*7* For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
*8* All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing fraudulent or perverse in them.
*9* They are all plain to him that understands, and right to them that find knowledge.
*10* Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
*11* For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
*12* I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
*13* The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the fraudulent mouth, do I hate.
*14* Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
*15* By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
*16* By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
*17* I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
*18* Riches and honor are with me; yes, durable riches and righteousness.
*19* My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
*20* I lead in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of judgment:
*21* That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
*22* The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
*23* I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
*24* When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
*25* Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
*26* While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
*27* When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass on the face of the depth:
*28* When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
*29* When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
*30* Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
*31* Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
*32* Now therefore listen to me, O you children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
*33* Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
*34* Blessed is the man that hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
*35* For whoever finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor of the LORD.
*36* But he that sins against me wrongs his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
* 9
*1* Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars:
*2* She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.
*3* She has sent forth her maidens: she cries on the highest places of the city,
*4* Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,
*5* Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
*6* Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
*7* He that reproves a scorner gets to himself shame: and he that rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot.
*8* Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you: rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
*9* Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
*10* The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
*11* For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.
*12* If you be wise, you shall be wise for yourself: but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.
*13* A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knows nothing.
*14* For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
*15* To call passengers who go right on their ways:
*16* Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,
*17* Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
*18* But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
* 10
*1* The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
*2* Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from death.
*3* The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casts away the substance of the wicked.
*4* He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
*5* He that gathers in summer is a wise son: but he that sleeps in harvest is a son that causes shame.
*6* Blessings are on the head of the just: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
*7* The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
*8* The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.
*9* He that walks uprightly walks surely: but he that perverts his ways shall be known.
*10* He that winks with the eye causes sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.
*11* The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
*12* Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.
*13* In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
*14* Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
*15* The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
*16* The labor of the righteous tends to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
*17* He is in the way of life that keeps instruction: but he that refuses reproof errs.
*18* He that hides hatred with lying lips, and he that utters a slander, is a fool.
*19* In the multitude of words there wants not sin: but he that refrains his lips is wise.
*20* The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
*21* The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.
*22* The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.
*23* It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding has wisdom.
*24* The fear of the wicked, it shall come on him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
*25* As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
*26* As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.
*27* The fear of the LORD prolongs days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
*28* The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
*29* The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
*30* The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
*31* The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom: but the fraudulent tongue shall be cut out.
*32* The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaks frowardness.
* 11
*1* A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.
*2* When pride comes, then comes shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.
*3* The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
*4* Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death.
*5* The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
*6* The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.
*7* When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perishes.
*8* The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead.
*9* An hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
*10* When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
*11* By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
*12* He that is void of wisdom despises his neighbor: but a man of understanding holds his peace.
*13* A talebearer reveals secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.
*14* Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
*15* He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hates indebtedness is sure.
*16* A gracious woman retains honor: and strong men retain riches.
*17* The merciful man does good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubles his own flesh.
*18* The wicked works a deceitful work: but to him that sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.
*19* As righteousness tends to life: so he that pursues evil pursues it to his own death.
*20* They that are of a fraudulent heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.
*21* Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
*22* As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.
*23* The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
*24* There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that withholds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty.
*25* The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that waters shall be watered also himself.
*26* He that withholds corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be on the head of him that sells it.
*27* He that diligently seeks good procures favor: but he that seeks mischief, it shall come to him.
*28* He that trusts in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
*29* He that troubles his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.
*30* The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.
*31* Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
* 12
*1* Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge: but he that hates reproof is brutish.
*2* A good man obtains favor of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
*3* A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.
*4* A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that makes ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.
*5* The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
*6* The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
*7* The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.
*8* A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
*9* He that is despised, and has a servant, is better than he that honors himself, and lacks bread.
*10* A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
*11* He that tills his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that follows vain persons is void of understanding.
*12* The wicked desires the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yields fruit.

*11* For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with you.
*12* Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.
*13* Withhold not correction from the child: for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die.
*14* You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from hell.
*15* My son, if your heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
*16* Yes, my reins shall rejoice, when your lips speak right things.
*17* Let not your heart envy sinners: but be you in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
*18* For surely there is an end; and your expectation shall not be cut off.
*19* Hear you, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.
*20* Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
*21* For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.
*22* Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.
*23* Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
*24* The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begets a wise child shall have joy of him.
*25* Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she that bore you shall rejoice.
*26* My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.
*27* For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
*28* She also lies in wait as for a prey, and increases the transgressors among men.
*29* Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?
*30* They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
*31* Look not you on the wine when it is red, when it gives his color in the cup, when it moves itself aright.
*32* At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.
*33* Your eyes shall behold strange women, and your heart shall utter perverse things.
*34* Yes, you shall be as he that lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he that lies on the top of a mast.
*35* They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
* 24
*1* Be not you envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
*2* For their heart studies destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
*3* Through wisdom is an house built; and by understanding it is established:
*4* And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
*5* A wise man is strong; yes, a man of knowledge increases strength.
*6* For by wise counsel you shall make your war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.
*7* Wisdom is too high for a fool: he opens not his mouth in the gate.
*8* He that devises to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
*9* The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.
*10* If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.
*11* If you forbear to deliver them that are drawn to death, and those that are ready to be slain;
*12* If you say, Behold, we knew it not; does not he that ponders the heart consider it? and he that keeps your soul, does not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?
*13* My son, eat you honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to your taste:
*14* So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul: when you have found it, then there shall be a reward, and your expectation shall not be cut off.
*15* Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:
*16* For a just man falls seven times, and rises up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
*17* Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles:
*18* Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
*19* Fret not yourself because of evil men, neither be you envious at the wicked:
*20* For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
*21* My son, fear you the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:
*22* For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knows the ruin of them both?
*23* These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
*24* He that said to the wicked, You are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
*25* But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come on them.
*26* Every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right answer.
*27* Prepare your work without, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterwards build your house.
*28* Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and deceive not with your lips.
*29* Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
*30* I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
*31* And, see, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
*32* Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked on it, and received instruction.
*33* Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
*34* So shall your poverty come as one that travels; and your want as an armed man.
* 25
*1* These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
*2* It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.
*3* The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
*4* Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
*5* Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
*6* Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
*7* For better it is that it be said to you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom your eyes have seen.
*8* Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbor has put you to shame.
*9* Debate your cause with your neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another:
*10* Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and your infamy turn not away.
*11* A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
*12* As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover on an obedient ear.
*13* As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
*14* Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
*15* By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
*16* Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.
*17* Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.
*18* A man that bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
*19* Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
*20* As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar on nitre, so is he that singes songs to an heavy heart.
*21* If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
*22* For you shall heap coals of fire on his head, and the LORD shall reward you.
*23* The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
*24* It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
*25* As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
*26* A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
*27* It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.
*28* He that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
* 26
*1* As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool.
*2* As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
*3* A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
*4* Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like to him.
*5* Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
*6* He that sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off the feet, and drinks damage.
*7* The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
*8* As he that binds a stone in a sling, so is he that gives honor to a fool.
*9* As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools.
*10* The great God that formed all things both rewards the fool, and rewards transgressors.
*11* As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.
*12* See you a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
*13* The slothful man said, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
*14* As the door turns on his hinges, so does the slothful on his bed.
*15* The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.
*16* The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
*17* He that passes by, and meddles with strife belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears.
*18* As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
*19* So is the man that deceives his neighbor, and said, Am not I in sport?
*20* Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.
*21* As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
*22* The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
*23* Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
*24* He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;
*25* When he speaks fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
*26* Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.
*27* Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.
*28* A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth works ruin.
* 27
*1* Boast not yourself of to morrow; for you know not what a day may bring forth.
*2* Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.
*3* A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
*4* Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?
*5* Open rebuke is better than secret love.
*6* Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
*7* The full soul loathes an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
*8* As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man that wanders from his place.
*9* Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
*10* Your own friend, and your father's friend, forsake not; neither go into your brother's house in the day of your calamity: for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
*11* My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproaches me.
*12* A prudent man foresees the evil, and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.
*13* Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
*14* He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
*15* A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
*16* Whoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which denudes itself.
*17* Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
*18* Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waits on his master shall be honored.
*19* As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man.
*20* Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
*21* As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.
*22* Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
*23* Be you diligent to know the state of your flocks, and look well to your herds.
*24* For riches are not for ever: and does the crown endure to every generation?
*25* The hay appears, and the tender grass shows itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
*26* The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
*27* And you shall have goats' milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, and for the maintenance for your maidens.
* 28
*1* The wicked flee when no man pursues: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
*2* For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
*3* A poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
*4* They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
*5* Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.
*6* Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
*7* Whoever keeps the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shames his father.
*8* He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
*9* He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.
*10* Whoever causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.
*11* The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that has understanding searches him out.
*12* When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
*13* He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.
*14* Happy is the man that fears always: but he that hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.
*15* As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
*16* The prince that wants understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hates covetousness shall prolong his days.
*17* A man that does violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
*18* Whoever walks uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
*19* He that tills his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that follows after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
*20* A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
*21* To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
*22* He that hastens to be rich has an evil eye, and considers not that poverty shall come on him.
*23* He that rebukes a man afterwards shall find more favor than he that flatters with the tongue.
*24* Whoever robs his father or his mother, and said, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.
*25* He that is of a proud heart stirs up strife: but he that puts his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
*26* He that trusts in his own heart is a fool: but whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered.
*27* He that gives to the poor shall not lack: but he that hides his eyes shall have many a curse.
*28* When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
* 29
*1* He, that being often reproved hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
*2* When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked bears rule, the people mourn.
*3* Whoever loves wisdom rejoices his father: but he that keeps company with harlots spends his substance.
*4* The king by judgment establishes the land: but he that receives gifts overthrows it.
*5* A man that flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
*6* In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous does sing and rejoice.
*7* The righteous considers the cause of the poor: but the wicked regards not to know it.
*8* Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.
*9* If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
*10* The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
*11* A fool utters all his mind: but a wise man keeps it in till afterwards.
*12* If a ruler listen to lies, all his servants are wicked.
*13* The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lightens both their eyes.
*14* The king that faithfully judges the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
*15* The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.
*16* When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases: but the righteous shall see their fall.
*17* Correct your son, and he shall give you rest; yes, he shall give delight to your soul.
*18* Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keeps the law, happy is he.
*19* A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
*20* See you a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
*21* He that delicately brings up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.
*22* An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in transgression.
*23* A man's pride shall bring him low: but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.
*24* Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul: he hears cursing, and denudes it not.
*25* The fear of man brings a snare: but whoever puts his trust in the LORD shall be safe.
*26* Many seek the ruler's favor; but every man's judgment comes from the LORD.
*27* An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.
* 30
*1* The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal,
*2* Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
*3* I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
*4* Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?
*5* Every word of God is pure: he is a shield to them that put their trust in him.
*6* Add you not to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
*7* Two things have I required of you; deny me them not before I die:
*8* Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
*9* Lest I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
*10* Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.
*11* There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
*12* There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
*13* There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
*14* There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
*15* The horse leach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yes, four things say not, It is enough:
*16* The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that said not, It is enough.
*17* The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
*18* There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yes, four which I know not:
*19* The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
*20* Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and said, I have done no wickedness.
*21* For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
*22* For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
*23* For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
*24* There be four things which are little on the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
*25* The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
*26* The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
*27* The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
*28* The spider takes hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
*29* There be three things which go well, yes, four are comely in going:
*30* A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turns not away for any;
*31* A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
*32* If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, lay your hand on your mouth.
*33* Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood: so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.
* 31
*1* The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
*2* What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
*3* Give not your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
*4* It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
*5* Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
*6* Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts.
*7* Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
*8* Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
*9* Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
*10* Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
*11* The heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
*12* She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
*13* She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
*14* She is like the merchants' ships; she brings her food from afar.
*15* She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
*16* She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
*17* She girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.
*18* She perceives that her merchandise is good: her candle goes not out by night.
*19* She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
*20* She stretches out her hand to the poor; yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
*21* She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
*22* She makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
*23* Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
*24* She makes fine linen, and sells it; and delivers girdles to the merchant.
*25* Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
*26* She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
*27* She looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.
*28* Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.
*29* Many daughters have done virtuously, but you excel them all.
*30* Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that fears the LORD, she shall be praised.
*31* Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.

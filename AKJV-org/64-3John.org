#+title: 3 John


*1* The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
*2* Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.
*3* For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.
*4* I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
*5* Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and to strangers;
*6* Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:
*7* Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
*8* We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.
*9* I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.
*10* Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.
*11* Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.
*12* Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yes, and we also bear record; and you know that our record is true.
*13* I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to you:
*14* But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.

*3* From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
*4* And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.
*5* And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.

*18* And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.

*23* Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.
*24* Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

*28* Of the children of Issachar, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
*29* Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.
*30* Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
*31* Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.
*32* Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
*33* Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.

*43* Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
*44* These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers.
*45* So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
*46* Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
*47* But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
*48* For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,
*49* Only you shall not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:
*50* But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister to it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
*51* And when the tabernacle sets forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.
*52* And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
*53* But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
*54* And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

* 5
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead:
*3* Both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the middle whereof I dwell.
*4* And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
*5* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*6* Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;
*7* Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.
*8* But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
*9* And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
*10* And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.
*11* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*12* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
*13* And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;
*14* And the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
*15* Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
*16* And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
*17* And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:
*18* And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse:
*19* And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man have lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, be you free from this bitter water that causes the curse:
*20* But if you have gone aside to another instead of your husband, and if you be defiled, and some man have lain with you beside your husband:
*21* Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD does make your thigh to rot, and your belly to swell;
*22* And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
*23* And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
*24* And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse: and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
*25* Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar:
*26* And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
*27* And when he has made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
*28* And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
*29* This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goes aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
*30* Or when the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute on her all this law.
*31* Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.

* 6
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves to the LORD:
*3* He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
*4* All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
*5* All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come on his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
*6* All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall come at no dead body.
*7* He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.
*8* All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
*9* And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
*10* And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
*11* And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
*12* And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
*13* And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
*14* And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
*15* And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
*16* And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
*17* And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*18* And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
*19* And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:
*20* And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.
*21* This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed, and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.
*22* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*23* Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,
*24* The LORD bless you, and keep you:
*25* The LORD make his face shine on you, and be gracious to you:
*26* The LORD lift up his countenance on you, and give you peace.
*27* And they shall put my name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.

* 7
*1* And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;
*2* That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:
*3* And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.
*4* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*5* Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
*6* And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
*7* Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
*8* And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
*9* But to the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them was that they should bear on their shoulders.
*10* And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
*11* And the LORD said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

* 8
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.
*3* And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.
*4* And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, to the shaft thereof, to the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according to the pattern which the LORD had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.
*5* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*6* Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
*7* And thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying on them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.
*8* Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.
*9* And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and you shall gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:
*10* And you shall bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands on the Levites:
*11* And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.
*12* And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bullocks: and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, to the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.
*13* And you shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering to the LORD.
*14* Thus shall you separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.
*15* And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.
*16* For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.
*17* For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
*18* And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
*19* And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.
*20* And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel to them.
*21* And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.
*22* And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they to them.
*23* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*24* This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
*25* And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the service thereof, and shall serve no more:
*26* But shall minister with their brothers in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites touching their charge.

* 9
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
*2* Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
*3* In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, you shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall you keep it.
*4* And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
*5* And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
*6* And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
*7* And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
*8* And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
*9* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*10* Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.
*11* The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
*12* They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
*13* But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and declines to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
*14* And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
*15* And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
*16* So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
*17* And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud stayed, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
*18* At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud stayed on the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
*19* And when the cloud tarried long on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
*20* And so it was, when the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they stayed in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
*21* And so it was, when the cloud stayed from even to the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
*22* Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried on the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel stayed in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
*23* At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

* 10
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
*3* And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
*4* And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
*5* When you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
*6* When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
*7* But when the congregation is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
*8* And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
*9* And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
*10* Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.
*11* And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
*12* And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
*13* And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
*14* In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
*15* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
*16* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
*17* And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
*18* And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
*19* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
*20* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
*21* And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.
*22* And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
*23* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
*24* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
*25* And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rear guard of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
*26* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
*27* And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
*28* Thus were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.
*29* And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.
*30* And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
*31* And he said, Leave us not, I pray you; for as much as you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you may be to us instead of eyes.
*32* And it shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to you.
*33* And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.
*34* And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.
*35* And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.
*36* And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.

* 11
*1* And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
*2* And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.
*3* And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
*4* And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
*5* We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
*6* But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
*7* And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.
*8* And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
*9* And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
*10* Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
*11* And Moses said to the LORD, Why have you afflicted your servant? and why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
*12* Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?
*13* From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
*14* I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
*15* And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
*16* And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.
*17* And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.
*18* And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and you shall eat flesh: for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.
*19* You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
*20* But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you: because that you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
*21* And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
*22* Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
*23* And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? you shall see now whether my word shall come to pass to you or not.
*24* And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.
*25* And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
*26* But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
*27* And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
*28* And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
*29* And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!
*30* And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
*31* And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high on the face of the earth.
*32* And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
*33* And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
*34* And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
*35* And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and stayed at Hazeroth.

* 12
*1* And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
*2* And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? has he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.
*3* (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.)
*4* And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
*5* And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
*6* And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.
*7* My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.
*8* With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
*9* And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
*10* And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
*11* And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech you, lay not the sin on us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
*12* Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
*13* And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech you.
*14* And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.
*15* And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
*16* And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.

* 13
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a ruler among them.
*3* And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
*4* And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
*5* Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
*6* Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
*7* Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
*8* Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
*9* Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
*10* Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
*11* Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
*12* Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
*13* Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
*14* Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
*15* Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
*16* These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.  And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
*17* And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
*18* And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
*19* And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
*20* And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be you of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
*21* So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
*22* And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
*23* And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two on a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
*24* The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from there.
*25* And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
*26* And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
*27* And they told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
*28* Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
*29* The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
*30* And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
*31* But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
*32* And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
*33* And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

* 14
*1* And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
*2* And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
*3* And why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
*4* And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
*5* Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
*6* And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
*7* And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
*8* If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
*9* Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
*10* But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
*11* And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?
*12* I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.
*13* And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)
*14* And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
*15* Now if you shall kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
*16* Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.
*17* And now, I beseech you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
*18* The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.
*19* Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
*20* And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word:
*21* But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
*22* Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;
*23* Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
*24* But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into where he went; and his seed shall possess it.
*25* (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelled in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
*26* And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
*27* How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
*28* Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:
*29* Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.
*30* Doubtless you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
*31* But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised.
*32* But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
*33* And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
*34* After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.
*35* I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
*36* And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander on the land,
*37* Even those men that did bring up the evil report on the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
*38* But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
*39* And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
*40* And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, See, we be here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned.
*41* And Moses said, Why now do you transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
*42* Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that you be not smitten before your enemies.
*43* For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
*44* But they presumed to go up to the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
*45* Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.

* 15
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
*3* And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet smell to the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:
*4* Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.
*5* And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shall you prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
*6* Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.
*7* And for a drink offering you shall offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet smell to the LORD.
*8* And when you prepare a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings to the LORD:
*9* Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
*10* And you shall bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.
*11* Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
*12* According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you do to every one according to their number.
*13* All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.
*14* And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.
*15* One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojournes with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
*16* One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you.
*17* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*18* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land where I bring you,
*19* Then it shall be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up an heave offering to the LORD.
*20* You shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as you do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you heave it.
*21* Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an heave offering in your generations.
*22* And if you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,
*23* Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;
*24* Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell to the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
*25* And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:
*26* And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojournes among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.
*27* And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
*28* And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
*29* You shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them.
*30* But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
*31* Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.
*32* And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.
*33* And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
*34* And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
*35* And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
*36* And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
*37* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*38* Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:
*39* And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to go a whoring:
*40* That you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
*41* I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

* 16
*1* Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
*2* And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
*3* And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
*4* And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face:
*5* And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.
*6* This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
*7* And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.
*8* And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, you sons of Levi:
*9* Seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
*10* And he has brought you near to him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you: and seek you the priesthood also?
*11* For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that you murmur against him?
*12* And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
*13* Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you make yourself altogether a prince over us?
*14* Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
*15* And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
*16* And Moses said to Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
*17* And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.
*18* And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
*19* And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
*20* And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
*21* Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
*22* And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be wroth with all the congregation?
*23* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*24* Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
*25* And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
*26* And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest you be consumed in all their sins.
*27* So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
*28* And Moses said, Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of my own mind.
*29* If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD has not sent me.
*30* But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
*31* And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them:
*32* And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.
*33* They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed on them: and they perished from among the congregation.
*34* And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
*35* And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
*36* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*37* Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
*38* The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
*39* And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
*40* To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
*41* But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of the LORD.
*42* And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
*43* And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
*44* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*45* Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell on their faces.
*46* And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
*47* And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the middle of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
*48* And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
*49* Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
*50* And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

* 17
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write you every man's name on his rod.
*3* And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
*4* And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
*5* And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
*6* And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
*7* And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
*8* And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
*9* And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
*10* And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
*11* And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
*12* And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
*13* Whoever comes any thing near to the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

* 18
*1* And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
*2* And your brothers also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
*3* And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor you also, die.
*4* And they shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come near to you.
*5* And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more on the children of Israel.
*6* And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
*7* Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.
*8* And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.
*9* This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
*10* In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to you.
*11* And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.
*12* All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.
*13* And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.
*14* Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.
*15* Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.
*16* And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
*17* But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the LORD.
*18* And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.
*19* All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.
*20* And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
*21* And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
*22* Neither must the children of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
*23* But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
*24* But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
*25* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*26* Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
*27* And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.
*28* Thus you also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and you shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
*29* Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
*30* Therefore you shall say to them, When you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.
*31* And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
*32* And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.

* 19
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
*2* This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and on which never came yoke:
*3* And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
*4* And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
*5* And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
*6* And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.
*7* Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
*8* And he that burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
*9* And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
*10* And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojournes among them, for a statute for ever.
*11* He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
*12* He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
*13* Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
*14* This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
*15* And every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
*16* And whoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
*17* And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
*18* And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons that were there, and on him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
*19* And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
*20* But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
*21* And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
*22* And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.

* 20
*1* Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
*2* And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
*3* And the people strived with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brothers died before the LORD!
*4* And why have you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
*5* And why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
*6* And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell on their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
*7* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*8* Take the rod, and gather you the assembly together, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so you shall give the congregation and their beasts drink.
*9* And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
*10* And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
*11* And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
*12* And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
*13* This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
*14* And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:
*15* How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelled in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
*16* And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border:
*17* Let us pass, I pray you, through your country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your borders.
*18* And Edom said to him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword.
*19* And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of your water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
*20* And he said, You shall not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
*21* Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away from him.
*22* And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.
*23* And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
*24* Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
*25* Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:
*26* And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.
*27* And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
*28* And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
*29* And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

* 21
*1* And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
*2* And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
*3* And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
*4* And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
*5* And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
*6* And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
*7* Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
*8* And the LORD said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks on it, shall live.
*9* And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it on a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
*10* And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
*11* And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rise.
*12* From there they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
*13* From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
*14* Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
*15* And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.
*16* And from there they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
*17* Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:
*18* The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
*19* And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
*20* And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.
*21* And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
*22* Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past your borders.
*23* And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
*24* And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
*25* And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
*26* For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
*27* Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
*28* For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
*29* Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
*30* We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.
*31* Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.
*32* And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
*33* And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
*34* And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.
*35* So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

* 22
*1* And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.
*2* And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
*3* And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
*4* And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.  And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
*5* He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
*6* Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.
*7* And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.
*8* And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
*9* And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?
*10* And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,
*11* Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
*12* And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people: for they are blessed.
*13* And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.
*14* And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.
*15* And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
*16* And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus said Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me:
*17* For I will promote you to very great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me: come therefore, I pray you, curse me this people.
*18* And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
*19* Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.
*20* And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.
*21* And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
*22* And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.
*23* And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
*24* But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
*25* And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
*26* And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
*27* And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
*28* And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have smitten me these three times?
*29* And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.
*30* And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I your ass, on which you have ridden ever since I was your to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? And he said, No.
*31* Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
*32* And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:
*33* And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.
*34* And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.
*35* And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
*36* And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
*37* And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? why came you not to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?
*38* And Balaam said to Balak, See, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
*39* And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth.
*40* And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
*41* And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.
* 23
*1* And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
*2* And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
*3* And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.
*4* And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
*5* And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.
*6* And he returned to him, and, see, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
*7* And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
*8* How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD has not defied?
*9* For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: see, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
*10* Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
*11* And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.
*12* And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?
*13* And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.
*14* And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
*15* And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
*16* And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.
*17* And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has the LORD spoken?
*18* And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:
*19* God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
*20* Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
*21* He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
*22* God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.
*23* Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!
*24* Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
*25* And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
*26* But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Told not I you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?
*27* And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray you, I will bring you to another place; peradventure it will please God that you may curse me them from there.
*28* And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.
*29* And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
*30* And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
* 24
*1* And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
*2* And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came on him.
*3* And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
*4* He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
*5* How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!
*6* As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD has planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.
*7* He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
*8* God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
*9* He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesses you, and cursed is he that curses you.
*10* And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
*11* Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, see, the LORD has kept you back from honor.
*12* And Balaam said to Balak, Spoke I not also to your messengers which you sent to me, saying,
*13* If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD said, that will I speak?
*14* And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
*15* And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
*16* He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
*17* I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
*18* And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
*19* Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remains of the city.
*20* And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
*21* And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.
*22* Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.
*23* And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this!
*24* And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
*25* And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
* 25
*1* And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab.
*2* And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
*3* And Israel joined himself to Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
*4* And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
*5* And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay you every one his men that were joined to Baalpeor.
*6* And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
*7* And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
*8* And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
*9* And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
*10* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*11* Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
*12* Why say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:
*13* And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
*14* Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
*15* And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
*16* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*17* Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
*18* For they vex you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
* 26
*1* And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
*2* Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
*3* And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
*4* Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.
*5* Reuben, the oldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom comes the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:

*9* And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD:
*10* And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

*52* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*53* To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
*54* To many you shall give the more inheritance, and to few you shall give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.
*55* Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
*56* According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.
*57* And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

*60* And to Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
*61* And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
*62* And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
*63* These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
*64* But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
*65* For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
* 27
*1* Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
*2* And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
*3* Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
*4* Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he has no son? Give to us therefore a possession among the brothers of our father.
*5* And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
*6* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*7* The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
*8* And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
*9* And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
*10* And if he have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
*11* And if his father have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.
*12* And the LORD said to Moses, Get you up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
*13* And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.
*14* For you rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
*15* And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
*16* Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
*17* Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
*18* And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;
*19* And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
*20* And you shall put some of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
*21* And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
*22* And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
*23* And he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
* 28
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet smell to me, shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.
*3* And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
*4* The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;
*5* And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.
*6* It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet smell, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.
*7* And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shall you cause the strong wine to be poured to the LORD for a drink offering.
*8* And the other lamb shall you offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, you shall offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.
*9* And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
*10* This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
*11* And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
*12* And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;
*13* And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering to one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet smell, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.
*14* And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine to a bullock, and the third part of an hin to a ram, and a fourth part of an hin to a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
*15* And one kid of the goats for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
*16* And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.
*17* And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
*18* In the first day shall be an holy convocation; you shall do no manner of servile work therein:
*19* But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be to you without blemish:
*20* And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall you offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;
*21* A several tenth deal shall you offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
*22* And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.
*23* You shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
*24* After this manner you shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
*25* And on the seventh day you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work.
*26* Also in the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new meat offering to the LORD, after your weeks be out, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work:
*27* But you shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet smell to the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;
*28* And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to one bullock, two tenth deals to one ram,
*29* A several tenth deal to one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;
*30* And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.
*31* You shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be to you without blemish) and their drink offerings.
* 29
*1* And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets to you.
*2* And you shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet smell to the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish:
*3* And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram,
*4* And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
*5* And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you:
*6* Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according to their manner, for a sweet smell, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.
*7* And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:
*8* But you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD for a sweet smell; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be to you without blemish:
*9* And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one ram,
*10* A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
*11* One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.
*12* And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:
*13* And you shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish:
*14* And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,
*15* And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:
*16* And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*17* And on the second day you shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:
*18* And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:
*19* And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and their drink offerings.
*20* And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish;
*21* And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:
*22* And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

*26* And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:
*27* And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:
*28* And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*29* And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish:

*31* And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*32* And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish:

*34* And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*35* On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly: you shall do no servile work therein:

*37* Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:
*38* And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.
*39* These things you shall do to the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.
*40* And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
* 30
*1* And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD has commanded.
*2* If a man vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
*3* If a woman also vow a vow to the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
*4* And her father hear her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
*5* But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears; not any of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
*6* And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, with which she bound her soul;
*7* And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
*8* But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
*9* But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
*10* And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
*11* And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
*12* But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
*13* Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
*14* But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he confirms them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
*15* But if he shall any ways make them void after that he has heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
*16* These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.
* 31
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shall you be gathered to your people.
*3* And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves to the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
*4* Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall you send to the war.
*5* So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
*6* And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
*7* And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
*8* And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
*9* And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
*10* And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
*11* And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
*12* And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
*13* And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
*14* And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
*15* And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?
*16* Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
*17* Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.
*18* But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
*19* And do you abide without the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
*20* And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
*21* And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
*22* Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
*23* Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.
*24* And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.
*25* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*26* Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
*27* And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
*28* And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
*29* Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.
*30* And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
*31* And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
*32* And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
*33* And three score and twelve thousand beeves,
*34* And three score and one thousand asses,
*35* And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
*36* And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
*37* And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and three score and fifteen.
*38* And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was three score and twelve.
*39* And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was three score and one.
*40* And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.
*41* And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
*42* And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
*43* (Now the half that pertained to the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
*44* And thirty and six thousand beeves,
*45* And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
*46* And sixteen thousand persons;)
*47* Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
*48* And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:
*49* And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.
*50* We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
*51* And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.
*52* And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
*53* (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
*54* And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
* 32
*1* Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
*2* The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
*3* Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
*4* Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle:
*5* Why, said they, if we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
*6* And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?
*7* And why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?
*8* Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
*9* For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
*10* And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
*11* Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
*12* Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
*13* And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
*14* And, behold, you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
*15* For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.
*16* And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
*17* But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
*18* We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
*19* For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
*20* And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,
*21* And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
*22* And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
*23* But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
*24* Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
*25* And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.
*26* Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
*27* But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord said.
*28* So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
*29* And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
*30* But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
*31* And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said to your servants, so will we do.
*32* We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.
*33* And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.
*34* And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
*35* And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
*36* And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
*37* And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
*38* And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.
*39* And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
*40* And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.
*41* And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.
*42* And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
* 33
*1* These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
*2* And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
*3* And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
*4* For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: on their gods also the LORD executed judgments.
*5* And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.
*6* And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
*7* And they removed from Etham, and turned again to Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.
*8* And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.
*9* And they removed from Marah, and came to Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and three score and ten palm trees; and they pitched there.
*10* And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.
*11* And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
*12* And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
*13* And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
*14* And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.
*15* And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai.
*16* And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah.
*17* And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.
*18* And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.
*19* And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.
*20* And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.
*21* And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.
*22* And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.
*23* And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.
*24* And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.
*25* And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.
*26* And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.
*27* And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.
*28* And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.
*29* And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.
*30* And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.
*31* And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.
*32* And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.
*33* And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.
*34* And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.
*35* And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.
*36* And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
*37* And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
*38* And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.
*39* And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.
*40* And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
*41* And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.
*42* And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.
*43* And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.
*44* And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.
*45* And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.
*46* And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.
*47* And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
*48* And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
*49* And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
*50* And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
*51* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
*52* Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
*53* And you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.
*54* And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.
*55* But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.
*56* Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them.
* 34
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*2* Command the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
*3* Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:
*4* And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:
*5* And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
*6* And as for the western border, you shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.
*7* And this shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall point out for you mount Hor:
*8* From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:
*9* And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.
*10* And you shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:
*11* And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
*12* And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.
*13* And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:
*14* For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
*15* The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sun rise.
*16* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*17* These are the names of the men which shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
*18* And you shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
*19* And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
*20* And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
*21* Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
*22* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
*23* The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
*24* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
*25* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
*26* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
*27* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
*28* And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
*29* These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
* 35
*1* And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
*2* Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
*3* And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
*4* And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
*5* And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
*6* And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which you shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them you shall add forty and two cities.
*7* So all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall you give with their suburbs.
*8* And the cities which you shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many you shall give many; but from them that have few you shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.
*9* And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
*10* Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
*11* Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which kills any person at unawares.
*12* And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
*13* And of these cities which you shall give six cities shall you have for refuge.
*14* You shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall you give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
*15* These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that kills any person unawares may flee thither.
*16* And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
*17* And if he smite him with throwing a stone, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
*18* Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
*19* The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.
*20* But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
*21* Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meets him.
*22* But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,
*23* Or with any stone, with which a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it on him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
*24* Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
*25* And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
*26* But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, where he was fled;
*27* And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
*28* Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
*29* So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
*30* Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
*31* Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
*32* And you shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
*33* So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
*34* Defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.
* 36
*1* And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
*2* And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
*3* And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
*4* And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
*5* And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.
*6* This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
*7* So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
*8* And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
*9* Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
*10* Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
*11* For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons:
*12* And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
*13* These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

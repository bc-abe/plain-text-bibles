#+title: Titus

* 1

*1* Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
*2* In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
*3* But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;
*4* To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
*5* For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:
*6* If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
*7* For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
*8* But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
*9* Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.
*10* For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
*11* Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
*12* One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
*13* This witness is true. Why rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
*14* Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
*15* To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
*16* They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.

*1* But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:
*2* That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
*3* The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
*4* That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
*5* To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
*6* Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
*7* In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,
*8* Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
*9* Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
*10* Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
*11* For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
*12* Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
*13* Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;
*14* Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
*15* These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.
* 3
*1* Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
*2* To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.
*3* For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
*4* But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,
*5* Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
*6* Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;
*7* That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
*8* This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
*9* But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
*10* A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;
*11* Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself.
*12* When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
*13* Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.
*14* And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
*15* All that are with me salute you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

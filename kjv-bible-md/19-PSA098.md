# Psalms 98
1. A Psalm. O sing unto YHWHew song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 
2. YHWHh made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 
3. He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
4. Make a joyful noise unto YHWHl the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
5. Sing unto YHWHh the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
6. With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before YHWHe King. 
7. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
8. Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together 
9. Before YHWHr he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.

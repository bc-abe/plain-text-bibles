# Hosea 6
1. Come, and let us return unto YHWH: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
2. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 
3. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know YHWH: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. 
4. ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. 
5. Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. 
6. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
7. But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 
8. Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood. 
9. And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 
10. I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
11. Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.

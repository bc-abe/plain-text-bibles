# Psalms 116
1. I love YHWH, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 
2. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 
3. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 
4. Then called I upon the name of YHWH; O YHWH, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
5. Gracious is YHWH, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 
6. YHWH preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 
7. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for YHWH hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
8. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
9. I will walk before YHWH in the land of the living. 
10. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
11. I said in my haste, All men are liars. 
12. What shall I render unto YHWH for all his benefits toward me? 
13. I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of YHWH. 
14. I will pay my vows unto YHWH now in the presence of all his people. 
15. Precious in the sight of YHWH is the death of his saints. 
16. O YHWH, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 
17. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of YHWH. 
18. I will pay my vows unto YHWH now in the presence of all his people, 
19. In the courts of YHWH’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye YHWH.

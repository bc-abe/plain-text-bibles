# Psalms  29
1. A Psalm of David. Give unto YHWH, O ye mighty, give unto YHWH glory and strength. 
2. Give unto YHWH the glory due unto his name; worship YHWH in the beauty of holiness. 
3. The voice of YHWH is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: YHWH is upon many waters. 
4. The voice of YHWH is powerful; the voice of YHWH is full of majesty. 
5. The voice of YHWH breaketh the cedars; yea, YHWH breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
6. He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
7. The voice of YHWH divideth the flames of fire. 
8. The voice of YHWH shaketh the wilderness; YHWH shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
9. The voice of YHWH maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
10. YHWH sitteth upon the flood; yea, YHWH sitteth King for ever. 
11. YHWH will give strength unto his people; YHWH will bless his people with peace.

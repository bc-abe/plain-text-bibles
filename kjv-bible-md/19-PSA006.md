# Psalms 6
1. To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O YHWH, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
2. Have mercy upon me, O YHWH; for I am weak: O YHWH, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 
3. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O YHWH, how long? 
4. Return, O YHWH, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake. 
5. For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? 
6. I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
7. Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 
8. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for YHWH hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
9. YHWH hath heard my supplication; YHWH will receive my prayer. 
10. Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

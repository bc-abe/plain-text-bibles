# Psalms 124
1. A Song of degrees of David. If it had not been YHWH who was on our side, now may Israel say; 
2. If it had not been YHWH who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 
3. Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
4. Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
5. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
6. Blessed be YHWH, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
7. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
8. Our help is in the name of YHWH, who made heaven and earth.

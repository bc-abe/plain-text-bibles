# Micah 3
1. And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? 
2. Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
3. Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
4. Then shall they cry unto YHWH, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. 
5. ¶ Thus saith YHWH concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. 
6. Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. 
7. Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. 
8. ¶ But truly I am full of power by the spirit of YHWH, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. 
9. Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 
10. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
11. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon YHWH, and say, Is not YHWH among us? none evil can come upon us. 
12. Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.

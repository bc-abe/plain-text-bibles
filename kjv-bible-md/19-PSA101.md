# Psalms 101
1. A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. 
2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 
4. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. 
5. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 
6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 
7. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 
8. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of YHWH.

# Ezekiel  25
1. The word of YHWH came again unto me, saying, 
2. Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 
3. And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of YHWH GOD; Thus saith YHWH GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 
4. Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
5. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am YHWH. 
6. For thus saith YHWH GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; 
7. Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am YHWH. 
8. ¶ Thus saith YHWH GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen; 
9. Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 
10. Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. 
11. And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am YHWH. 
12. ¶ Thus saith YHWH GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 
13. Therefore thus saith YHWH GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 
14. And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith YHWH GOD. 
15. ¶ Thus saith YHWH GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred; 
16. Therefore thus saith YHWH GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
17. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am YHWH, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

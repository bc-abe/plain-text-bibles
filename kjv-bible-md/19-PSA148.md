# Psalms  148
1. Praise ye YHWH. Praise ye YHWH from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 
2. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 
3. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 
4. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 
5. Let them praise the name of YHWH: for he commanded, and they were created. 
6. He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. 
7. Praise YHWH from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 
8. Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word: 
9. Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
10. Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: 
11. Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: 
12. Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: 
13. Let them praise the name of YHWH: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 
14. He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye YHWH.

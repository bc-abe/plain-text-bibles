# Jonah 2
1. Then Jonah prayed unto YHWH his God out of the fish’s belly, 
2. And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto YHWH, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. 
3. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. 
4. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 
5. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. 
6. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O YHWH my God. 
7. When my soul fainted within me I remembered YHWH: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. 
8. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
9. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of YHWH. 
10. ¶ And YHWH spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

# Psalms 108
1. A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
3. I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
4. For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
5. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 
6. That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
7. God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
9. Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 
10. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
11. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
12. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
13. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

# Psalms 132
1. A Song of degrees. YHWH, remember David, and all his afflictions: 
2. How he sware unto YHWH, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 
3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 
4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 
5. Until I find out a place for YHWH, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 
6. Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 
7. We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 
8. Arise, O YHWH, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
9. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 
10. For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
11. YHWH hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
12. If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 
13. For YHWH hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 
14. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
15. I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
16. I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
17. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 
18. His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

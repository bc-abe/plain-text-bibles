# Psalms 82
1. A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 
2. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
3. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. 
4. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 
5. They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 
6. I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. 
7. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 
8. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.

# Psalms 114
1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
2. Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 
3. The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 
4. The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. 
5. What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 
6. Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? 
7. Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of YHWH, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
8. Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

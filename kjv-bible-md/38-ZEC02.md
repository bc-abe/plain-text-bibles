# Zechariah 2
1. I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
2. Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 
3. And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
4. And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: 
5. For I, saith YHWH, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. 
6. ¶ Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith YHWH: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith YHWH. 
7. Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. 
8. For thus saith YHWH of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 
9. For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that YHWH of hosts hath sent me. 
10. ¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith YHWH. 
11. And many nations shall be joined to YHWH in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that YHWH of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
12. And YHWH shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 
13. Be silent, O all flesh, before YHWH: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.

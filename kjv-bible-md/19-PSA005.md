# Psalms 5
1. To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O YHWH, consider my meditation. 
2. Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. 
3. My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O YHWH; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. 
4. For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. 
5. The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
6. Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: YHWH will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
7. But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 
8. Lead me, O YHWH, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 
9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 
10. Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 
11. But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
12. For thou, YHWH, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.

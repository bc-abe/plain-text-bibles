# Psalms 131
1. A Song of degrees of David. YHWH, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 
2. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 
3. Let Israel hope in YHWH from henceforth and for ever.

# Psalms 149
1. Praise ye YHWH. Sing unto YHWH a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. 
2. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
3. Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
4. For YHWH taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 
5. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 
6. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; 
7. To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; 
8. To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
9. To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye YHWH.

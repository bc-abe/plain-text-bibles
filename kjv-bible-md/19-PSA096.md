# Psalms  96
1. O sing unto YHWH a new song: sing unto YHWH, all the earth. 
2. Sing unto YHWH, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 
3. Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 
4. For YHWH is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
5. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but YHWH made the heavens. 
6. Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
7. Give unto YHWH, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto YHWH glory and strength. 
8. Give unto YHWH the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
9. O worship YHWH in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 
10. Say among the heathen that YHWH reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 
11. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 
12. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 
13. Before YHWH: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

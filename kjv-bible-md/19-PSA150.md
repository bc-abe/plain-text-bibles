# Psalms 150
1. Praise ye YHWH. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 
2. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 
3. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
4. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
5. Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
6. Let every thing that hath breath praise YHWH. Praise ye YHWH.

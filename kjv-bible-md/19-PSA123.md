# Psalms  123
1. A Song of degrees. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
2. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon YHWH our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 
3. Have mercy upon us, O YHWH, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

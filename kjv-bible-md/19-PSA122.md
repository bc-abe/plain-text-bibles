# Psalms 122
1. A Song of degrees of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of YHWH. 
2. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
3. Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 
4. Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of YHWH, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of YHWH. 
5. For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 
7. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
8. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 
9. Because of the house of YHWH our God I will seek thy good.

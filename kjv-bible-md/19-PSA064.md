# Psalms 64
1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
3. Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 
4. That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 
6. They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 
7. But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 
8. So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. 
9. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 
10. The righteous shall be glad in YHWH, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

# Psalms 100
1. A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise unto YHWH, all ye lands. 
2. Serve YHWH with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 
3. Know ye that YHWH he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
4. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 
5. For YHWH is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.

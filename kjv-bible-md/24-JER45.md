# Jeremiah 45
1. The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
2. Thus saith YHWH, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; 
3. Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for YHWH hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. 
4. ¶ Thus shalt thou say unto him, YHWH saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. 
5. And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith YHWH: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

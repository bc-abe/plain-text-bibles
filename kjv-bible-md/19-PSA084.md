# Psalms 84
1. To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
2. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of YHWH: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
3. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 
4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 
5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. 
6. Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 
7. They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 
8. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
9. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 
10. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11. For YHWH God is a sun and shield: YHWH will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
12. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

# Psalms 26
1. By David. Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering. 
2. Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind. 
3. For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth. 
4. I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites. 
5. I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked. 
6. I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Yahweh, 
7. that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard and tell of all your wondrous deeds. 
8. Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells. 
9. Don’t gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men; 
10. in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes. 
11. But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me. 
12. My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.

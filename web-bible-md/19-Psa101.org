# Psalms 101
1. A Psalm by David. I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises. 
2. I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart. 
3. I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me. 
4. A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil. 
5. I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited. 
6. My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me. 
7. He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes. 
8. Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh’s city.

# Psalms 131
1. A Song of Ascents. By David. Yahweh, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me. 
2. Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 
3. Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forward and forever more.

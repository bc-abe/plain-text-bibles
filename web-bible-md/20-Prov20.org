# Proverbs 20
1. Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.

6. Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find a faithful man? 
7. A righteous man walks in integrity. Blessed are his children after him. 
8. A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes. 
9. Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. I am clean and without sin?”

12. The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even both of them. 
13. Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty. Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. 
14. “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. 
15. There is gold and abundance of rubies, but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. 
16. Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman. 
17. Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. 
18. Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!

23. Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing. 
24. A man’s steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way?

27. The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp, searching all his innermost parts. 
28. Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by love. 
29. The glory of young men is their strength. The splendor of old men is their gray hair. 
30. Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the innermost parts.

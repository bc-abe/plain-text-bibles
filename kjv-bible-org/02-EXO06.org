* Exodus 6
1. Then YHWH said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 
2. And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am YHWH: 
3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
4. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 
5. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
6. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am YHWH, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 
7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am YHWH your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
8. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am YHWH. 
9. ¶ And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
10. And YHWH spake unto Moses, saying, 
11. Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
12. And Moses spake before YHWH, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 
13. And YHWH spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

25. And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. 
26. These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom YHWH said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 
27. These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 
28. ¶ And it came to pass on the day when YHWH spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 
29. That YHWH spake unto Moses, saying, I am YHWH: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 
30. And Moses said before YHWH, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

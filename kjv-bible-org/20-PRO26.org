* Proverbs 26
1. As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. 
2. As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. 
3. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back. 
4. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. 
5. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
6. He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. 
7. The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 
8. As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. 
9. As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 
10. The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 
11. As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. 
12. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 
13. The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. 
14. As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. 
15. The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
16. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 
17. He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
18. As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 
19. So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 
20. Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 
21. As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 
22. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 
23. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. 
24. He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 
25. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. 
26. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. 
27. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. 
28. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.

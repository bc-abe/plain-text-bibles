* Psalms 13
1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O YHWH? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
3. Consider and hear me, O YHWH my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
5. But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
6. I will sing unto YHWH, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

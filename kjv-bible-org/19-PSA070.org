* Psalms 70
1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O YHWH. 
2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
3. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 
4. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 
5. But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O YHWH, make no tarrying.

* Psalms 12
1. To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
2. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. 
3. YHWH shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: 
4. Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 
5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith YHWH; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. 
6. The words of YHWH are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
7. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
8. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.

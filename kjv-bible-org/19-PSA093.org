* Psalms  93
1. YHWH reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; YHWH is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 
2. Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 
3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 
4. YHWH on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 
5. Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.

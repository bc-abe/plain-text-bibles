* Hosea 14
1. O Israel, return unto YHWH thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 
2. Take with you words, and turn to YHWH: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. 
3. Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 
4. ¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
5. I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 
6. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 
7. They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 
8. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. 
9. Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of YHWH are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

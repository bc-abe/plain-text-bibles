* Psalms 130
1. A Song of degrees. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O YHWH. 
2. YHWH, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
3. If thou, YHWH, shouldest mark iniquities, O YHWH, who shall stand? 
4. But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
5. I wait for YHWH, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 
6. My soul waiteth for YHWH more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 
7. Let Israel hope in YHWH: for with YHWH there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 
8. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

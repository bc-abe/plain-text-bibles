* Malachi  1
1. The burden of the word of YHWH to Israel by Malachi. 
2. I have loved you, saith YHWH. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith YHWH: yet I loved Jacob, 
3. And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. 
4. Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith YHWH of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom YHWH hath indignation for ever. 
5. And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, YHWH will be magnified from the border of Israel. 
6. ¶ A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith YHWH of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
7. Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of YHWH is contemptible. 
8. And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith YHWH of hosts. 
9. And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith YHWH of hosts. 
10. Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith YHWH of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 
11. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith YHWH of hosts. 
12. ¶ But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of YHWH is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. 
13. Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith YHWH of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith YHWH. 
14. But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto YHWH a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith YHWH of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

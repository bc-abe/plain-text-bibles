* Psalms  60
1. To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 
2. Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 
3. Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
4. Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
5. That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 
6. God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
8. Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 
9. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
10. Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 
11. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
12. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

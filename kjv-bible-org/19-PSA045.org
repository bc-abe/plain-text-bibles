* Psalms 45
1. To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 
2. Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 
4. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 
5. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. 
6. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. 
7. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
8. All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. 
9. Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 
10. Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; 
11. So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy YHWH; and worship thou him. 
12. And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. 
13. The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. 
14. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. 
15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace. 
16. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 
17. I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

* Psalms 138
1. A Psalm of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. 
2. I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
3. In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 
4. All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O YHWH, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 
5. Yea, they shall sing in the ways of YHWH: for great is the glory of YHWH. 
6. Though YHWH be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. 
7. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. 
8. YHWH will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O YHWH, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.

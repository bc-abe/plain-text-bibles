* Psalms  128
1. A Song of degrees. Blessed is every one that feareth YHWH; that walketh in his ways. 
2. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 
3. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 
4. Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth YHWH. 
5. YHWH shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
6. Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.

*Psalm 46
/To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth./ 
# God's present help is with us today
1. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
2. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
3. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. [[file:35-HAB03.org::18][Hab 3:17-19]] 
# Look at the City of God
4. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glai the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. [[file:66-REV22.org][Rev 22:1]] 
5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 
6. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
7. YHWH of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
# Look at God's Works on the Earth
8. Come, behold the works of YHWH, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
9. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
10. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
11. YHWH of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

* Psalms 23
1. A Psalm of David. YHWH is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 
3. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 
5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of YHWH for ever.

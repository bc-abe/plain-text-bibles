* Psalms 75
1. To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 
2. When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 
3. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 
4. I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
5. Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 
6. For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 
7. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 
8. For in the hand of YHWH there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. 
9. But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
10. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

* Psalms 142
1. Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave. I cried unto YHWH with my voice; with my voice unto YHWH did I make my supplication. 
2. I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 
3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 
4. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
5. I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 
6. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 
7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.

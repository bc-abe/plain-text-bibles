* Psalms 22
1. To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 
2. O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 
3. But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
4. Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
5. They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. 
6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 
7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 
8. He trusted on YHWH that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. 
9. But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother’s breasts. 
10. I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother’s belly. 
11. Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. 
12. Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 
13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 
14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 
15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
16. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 
17. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. 
18. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 
19. But be not thou far from me, O YHWH: O my strength, haste thee to help me. 
20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. 
21. Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 
22. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 
23. Ye that fear YHWH, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
24. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 
25. My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 
26. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise YHWH that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 
27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto YHWH: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 
28. For the kingdom is YHWH’s: and he is the governor among the nations. 
29. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. 
30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to YHWH for a generation. 
31. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

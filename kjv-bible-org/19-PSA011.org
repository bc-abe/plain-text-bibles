* Psalms 11
1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In YHWH put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 
2. For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 
3. If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 
4. YHWH is in his holy temple, YHWH’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 
5. YHWH trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 
7. For the righteous YHWH loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.

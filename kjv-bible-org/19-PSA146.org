* Psalms 146
1. Praise ye YHWH. Praise YHWH, O my soul. 
2. While I live will I praise YHWH: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
3. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
4. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 
5. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in YHWH his God: 
6. Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 
7. Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. YHWH looseth the prisoners: 
8. YHWH openeth the eyes of the blind: YHWH raiseth them that are bowed down: YHWH loveth the righteous: 
9. YHWH preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 
10. YHWH shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye YHWH.

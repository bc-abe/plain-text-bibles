* Psalms 26
1. A Psalm of David. Judge me, O YHWH; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in YHWH; therefore I shall not slide. 
2. Examine me, O YHWH, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
3. For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
4. I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
5. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 
6. I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O YHWH: 
7. That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
8. YHWH, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
9. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 
10. In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
11. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 
12. My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless YHWH.

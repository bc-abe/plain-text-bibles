* 1 Samuel  3
1. And the child Samuel ministered unto YHWH before Eli. And the word of YHWH was precious in those days; there was no open vision. 
2. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; 
3. And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of YHWH, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 
4. That YHWH called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. 
5. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 
6. And YHWH called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. 
7. Now Samuel did not yet know YHWH, neither was the word of YHWH yet revealed unto him. 
8. And YHWH called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that YHWH had called the child. 
9. Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
10. And YHWH came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. 
11. ¶ And YHWH said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. 
12. In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. 
13. For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. 
14. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 
15. ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of YHWH. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 
16. Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. 
17. And he said, What is the thing that YHWH hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. 
18. And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is YHWH: let him do what seemeth him good. 
19. ¶ And Samuel grew, and YHWH was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 
20. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of YHWH. 
21. And YHWH appeared again in Shiloh: for YHWH revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of YHWH.

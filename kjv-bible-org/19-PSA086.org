* Psalms 86
1. A Prayer of David. Bow down thine ear, O YHWH, hear me: for I am poor and needy. 
2. Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 
3. Be merciful unto me, O YHWH: for I cry unto thee daily. 
4. Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O YHWH, do I lift up my soul. 
5. For thou, YHWH, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 
6. Give ear, O YHWH, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
7. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. 
8. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O YHWH; neither are there any works like unto thy works. 
9. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O YHWH; and shall glorify thy name. 
10. For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. 
11. Teach me thy way, O YHWH; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
12. I will praise thee, O YHWH my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
13. For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
14. O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. 
15. But thou, O YHWH, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
16. O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 
17. Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, YHWH, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

* Psalms 61
1. To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 
2. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
3. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. 
4. I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
5. For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
6. Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: and his years as many generations. 
7. He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 
8. So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

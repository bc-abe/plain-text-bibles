* Psalms 99
1. YHWH reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 
2. YHWH is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 
3. Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 
4. The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
5. Exalt ye YHWH our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 
6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon YHWH, and he answered them. 
7. He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 
8. Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 
9. Exalt YHWH our God, and worship at his holy hill; for YHWH our God is holy.

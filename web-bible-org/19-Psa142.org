* Psalms 142
1. A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer. I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy. 
2. I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles. 
3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my route. On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me. 
4. Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul. 
5. I cried to you, Yahweh. I said, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.” 
6. Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 
7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.

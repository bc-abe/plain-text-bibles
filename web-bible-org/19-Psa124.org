* Psalms 124
1. A Song of Ascents. By David. If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say, 
2. if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us; 
3. then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; 
4. then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul; 
5. then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. 
6. Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
7. Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 
8. Our help is in Yahweh’s name, who made heaven and earth.
